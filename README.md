for first problem i used reactjs with vite. as it is having visual graphics i thought that would be appropriate.
and to impliment graphs visualy i used d3 from (https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3) and (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-started-with-d3-and-react-c7da74a5bd9f/)
(https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_graphics_d3js.asp)

for second and third problem i used c++ to solve the codes.
